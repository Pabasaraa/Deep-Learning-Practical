# Deep Learning Labs & Practical
## This repo contains all the lab &amp; practical exercises done in the Deep Learning module (SE4050)


Lab 01 - Familiarize the libraries that are commonly used in deep learning (Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn)
Lab 02 - Familiarize the backpropagation with different numbers of hidden layers, and how accuracy of the models changes when change the number of nodes.
